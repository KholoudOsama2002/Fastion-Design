        <h2 class="style">What Is Fashion?</h2>
        <p>
            <h5>Fashion is the dominant style within a given culture at a certain time. Fashion has to do with new trends: It refers to popular ways of dressing during a specific era.

                The fashion industry deals with the prevailing styles of the present. Fashion houses host fashion shows to highlight clothing that expresses a vision for the future of fashion. Fashion bloggers, editors, and influencers then respond to that vision with their own ideas, and retailers use all that information to sell clothes to the public. A major part of fashion is the way the latest trends are disseminated, whether via social media or in fashion magazines like Vogue.</h5>

        <h2>Designer Shares Tips for Creating Your Own Fashion Design Process:</h2>
        <p class="design">The design process establishes every conversation, bolt of fabric, and meeting you will pursue for a full collection. Establishing this individual process is what can set the tone for your collection and brand when every season arises. Not only does a collection have to be cohesive, but your brand has to be cohesive. Every collection has to be cohesive with your previous collections. This is what will help you identify your niche, customer, and image in the market. A design process is the template to ensure every collection will fit with your signatures. However, it also leaves room to grow as you emerge into the industry.</p>

        <p class="collect">My design process for my collections always begins with establishing a mood and an atmosphere that fits with the clientele’s lifestyle and my design aesthetic. For example, my inspiration is the New York City woman spending an evening in the brightly lit city, and by day working and pursuing business in Paris. If you have a vision, act upon it and let it drive the sketches. Cycling your inspiration through a consistent thought process every season can eventually lead you to developing a signature lifestyle, clientele, and aesthetic. This will also help people recognize your brand without seeing the label.</p>

        <h1>What Is the Difference Between Style and Fashion?</h1>
        <p>There is an overlap between style and fashion, but a good rule of thumb is that style relates to the individual, while fashion is more collective. Let’s break down the differences</p>

                <td>How they dress and express themselves is their style. Fashion, on the other hand, has to do with global trends and the business of fashion. The lines between fashion and style are blurry. On the catwalk, a model is part of the fashion world. The way they dress at home, however, is personal style. When they become an influencer and their personal style becomes iconic, they may start their own clothing line, turning their style into fashion.</td>

Someone who is stylish may or may not follow fashion trends, but they always stay true to their own aesthetic. Personal style is about developing a sense of self, rather than simply absorbing trends.
                    Fashion and style overlap in the street style that photographers capture outside of fashion shows. The subjects photographed are typically models, stylists, and fashion editors wearing the clothes of the designers whose shows they are attending, but they've taken the clothes and styled them to work for real life, effectively merging fashion with style.</td>
